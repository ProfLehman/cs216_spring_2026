# CS216 – Programming Assignment P1
**Software Development**

## Requirements

Many “experts” recommend taking **10,000 steps each day**. An exercise science instructor would like an application that calculates the **number of miles walked** given the number of steps taken and the length of stride in inches.

Write a **Python** program that inputs the number of steps taken and the stride length in inches.

### Input Notes

Print the input message *before* reading the value, exactly as shown in the following example:

```python
print("Enter float value: ")
value = float(input())
```

---

## Program Requirements

Your program must:

1. Input the number of steps taken.
2. Input the stride length in inches.
3. Calculate the number of miles walked.
4. Display the number of miles walked **formatted to two decimal places**.

The format of the output message **must be exactly**:

```
You walked 5000 steps which is 1.87 miles
```

---

## Step Count Messages

Your program must also display **one** of the following messages depending on the number of steps:

* **If the number of steps is less than 10,000**

  ```
  You need 9999 more steps to reach 10,000
  ```

* **If the number of steps is greater than 10,000**

  ```
  You were 3000 steps over 10,000
  ```

* **If the number of steps is exactly 10,000**

  ```
  You walked exactly 10,000 steps
  ```

## Planning and Submission Requirements

### 1. IPO Chart

Create an **Input–Processing–Output (IPO)** chart to plan your program.

* Upload to Moodle as a **PDF**.

### 2. Sample Calculations

Create **two sample calculations by hand** to test your program.

* Upload to Moodle as **a single PDF**.
* To create a PDF:

  * Copy and paste images into a word processor and save as PDF, **or**
  * Use “scan to PDF” on campus copiers/printers.

### 3. Program Submission

Submit your Python program for grading.

* You may submit your program **as many times as needed** to pass the sample output tests.

## Sample Output

### When input is:

```
3000
28
```

### Output:

```
Enter number of steps
Enter stride distance in inches
You walked 3000 steps which is 1.33 miles
You need 7000 more steps to reach 10,000
```

---

### When input is:

```
12500
28
```

### Output:

```
Enter number of steps
Enter stride distance in inches
You walked 12500 steps which is 5.52 miles
You were 2500 steps over 10,000
```

---

### When input is:

```
10000
28
```

### Output:

```
Enter number of steps
Enter stride distance in inches
You walked 10000 steps which is 4.42 miles
You walked exactly 10,000 steps
```
