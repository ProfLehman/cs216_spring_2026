## Grading

Each course component is worth a specific number of points. The percentage of total points determines the final grade. The instructor reserves the right to adjust assignments and points while maintaining overall percentage weightings.

| Component                         | Points | Percent |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Active Course Engagement          | 50     | 5%      |
| zyBooks Textbook Exercises & Labs | 150    | 15%     |
| Problem Sets (x10 approx.)        | 300    | 30%     |
| Exams (x3)                        | 375    | 37.5%   |
| Final Exam                        | 125    | 12.5%   |

## Active Course Engagement (5%)

Active Course Engagement is vital for success in this course. Weekly readings and textbook exercises present the course material and provide the background needed to complete problem sets and prepare for exams. Students are encouraged to take notes summarizing topics covered in class and while working through, zyBooks exercises and labs. Students are encouraged to utilize office hours and send questions via email and text.

**Active Course Engagement grades** are recorded after each exam: 13 points after Exam #1, 13 points after Exam #2, 13 points after Exam #3, and 11 points after Final Exam. Scores are based on attendance, in-class work, weekly assignments, timely completion of zyBooks exercises and labs, communication with the instructor (such as asking questions or sharing insights), a participation self-reflection, and the instructor’s observations. **Active Course Engagement is not a single assignment but a cumulative assessment of participation and engagement over time.**

### Attendance

Class sessions enable you to engage with the material, providing opportunities to ask questions, participate in discussions, and work through assignments with instructor support. 

Attendance is recorded at the beginning of class. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, arrive on time, stay actively engaged, complete all in-class assignments, refrain from using phones/computers for non-course purposes, and remain in class for the entire session (except during breaks for emergencies). Late arrivals, early departures, and taking breaks during class may be treated as partial or full absences. 

Huntington University policy requires students to attend at least two-thirds (2/3) of scheduled class sessions in a face-to-face course. **Students who miss one-third or more of class meetings will automatically fail the course.** This total includes excused absences for athletics, music, other university activities, or illness. Students are responsible for all material they miss.

If you arrive late or need to leave early, use the door opposite the instructor (SH 175) workstation and do so quietly. Attending part of a session is better than missing entirely.

Do not attend class if you are sick. Your health and the health of others comes first.

If you miss class, please get in touch with Prof. Lehman. Students who miss multiple sessions may be referred to Student Services, the Dean’s Office, or the Registrar for support.

Virtual class sessions may be scheduled occasionally when the instructor has a course-related conflict. These sessions are considered regular class meetings, and attendance and participation are required.

---

## Problem Sets (30%)

Weekly problem sets are assigned throughout the semester. These assignments are designed to help you apply and integrate the concepts discussed in the text, online resources, and class sessions. The material covered will assist students in preparing for course examinations. Please ensure your work is neat, organized, and clearly labeled with your first and last name. Add your name to program comments for all code submitted. Most coding assignments will be submitted through zyBooks.

---

## zyBooks Textbook (15%)

Textbook participation, challenge exercises, and labs will be assigned for each chapter. Grades will be based on the percentage completed. Suggested due dates for each chapter are given for completing each chapter, however, **scores are only entered after each exam**.  

Many chapters and sections are listed as "optional" and thus not required or counted towards the textbook grade. Students are encouraged to explore these optional topics to further develop their skills and knowledge.

Timely completion of zyBooks work will inform our Active Particiption grade. Students are encouraged to complete zyBooks material on a weekly bases. It is critical to complete the related material for each Problem set.


---

## Late Work Policy

Students should complete class assignments before the assigned due date and time. Unless otherwise noted, late work is accepted up to 48 hours late with a 10% penalty. Students should notify the instructor for cases of extreme hardship for which it may be possible to arrange alternate due dates. The instructor will post grades on Moodle. Please review the graded work and report any discrepancies. Students are encouraged to save returned assignments to document earned points.

### Programming Tools

- **Python 3** will be used for coding assignments.
- **Thonny IDE** (recommended offline editor): <https://thonny.org/>  
- **Google Colab** (Python examples): <https://colab.google/>  
- **GitHub** (hosting web pages): <https://github.com/>

## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism

Integrity is essential. Plagiarism includes submitting work that is not your own, copying answers, failing to cite sources, using AI when prohibited, or treating individual assignments as group work.

Consequences may include a failing assignment grade, failure of the course, and referral to the Academic Dean.

Plagiarism is using another’s ideas, information, or wording without proper acknowledgment. All quoted, paraphrased, or summarized material must be cited. Common knowledge is the only exception.

---

## AI Statement

This course permits AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly) to assist with learning and development.

Students may use AI to:
- Understand concepts  
- Receive feedback on writing  
- Debug code  
- Generate practice problems  

Students must understand and be able to explain all submitted work. AI tools are **not allowed on exams**.

Assignments will include AI usage guidelines:  
- **Red:** No AI use  
- **Yellow:** Limited / cautious AI use    
- **Green:** AI freely allowed  
 

Improper AI use is considered cheating and/or plagiarism.
