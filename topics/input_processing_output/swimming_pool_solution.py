 Sample Calculations and Expected Output

 Test your IPO plan by creating two (or more) sample calculations
 showing the inputs and expected outputs
 
 Key ideas are to verify that your IPO plan works
 *and* that you can test that your code works when it runs

 length, width, depth => gallons, trips
   20     10      6       9,000     3
   50     40      7      105,000    27
   10     4       2        600      1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 Input
    length of pool (length)
    width of pool (width)
    depth of pool (depth)

 Processing
    calculate the (volume) of the pool
       volume = length * width * depth
 
    calculate the (gallons) of water needed
       gallons = volume * 7.5

    calculate the number of (trips) given that a truck holds 4,000 gallons of water
       trips = gallons / 4000
       note: need to round up, so trips = math.ceil(trips)
    
    note: Use if statement to determine if trips <= 1 or trips > 1

 Output
     (gallons) of water needed
     (trips) needed to fill pool
